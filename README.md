# MetaboKit-Data-Processing
Code available uses MetaboKit (DDA v20240513). MetaboKit auto-generates .tsv files post-processing the data, this R code is used to specifically filter the data as a general compound screening workflow.
Presumes samples are run in in DDA mode using iterative exclusion injections during data acquisition. 
Need to define mode as "positive" or "negative", and .tsv file exclusively.
